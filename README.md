# ✈️ Plane Watch Aircraft Silhouettes

This repository contains aircraft silhouette artwork and metadata used to build a spritesheet for Plane Watch.

Silhouettes are stored as SVG files and compiled into:

- **spritesheet.png** — a packed sheet of aircraft sprites  
- **spritesheet.json** — metadata describing sprite positions and animation frames  

These outputs are generated using the `build_spritesheet` tool.

---

## 📦 Releases

Regular releases of this repository include prebuilt versions of:

- `spritesheet.png`
- `spritesheet.json`

These are intended for direct use in Plane Watch and other consumers without needing to build locally.

## 🤝 Contributions Welcome!

We’d love help expanding the aircraft library. If there’s a common aircraft type in your region that isn’t represented yet, please consider contributing a silhouette.

👉 **All contribution guidelines (JSON format, SVG rules, and validation requirements) are documented in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).**

Pull requests automatically run validation checks to ensure new files match the required formats.

## Reference Artwork Notice

Some SVG files in this repository may contain a "Reference Artwork" layer used during the creation of silhouettes. These reference images were sourced from
publicly available materials such as aircraft three-view diagrams, manufacturer data sheets and brouchures.

These reference images are used solely as visual guides during the tracing process and are **not part of the final silhouette artwork**. The reference layers may be removed at any time and are not required for use of the silhouettes.

We do not claim ownership of any third-party reference images, and no rights to those materials are granted by this repository. The Creative Commons license applies **only to the original silhouette artwork and associated metadata** created for this project.
